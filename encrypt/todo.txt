• encode numbers for file type length, IV length, and salt length, as binary in single byte
• change encrypt signature to take pure read/write streams and an options object for the rest
• write new file type
  - come up with scheme to save:
	file type (file extension) (and file extension length)
	iv
	data
• re-write as cli tool with flags
  - look at comander (other ones too)
• take input from stdin (optional flag) so can be unix piped
• send output to stdout (optional flag) so can be unix piped
• allow user to specify format to save it in (and read it in)
  - store somewhere (1 byte) type data storage 
• store salt in file also
• delete original file after writing new .brad file
• if exeption occurs write back original file to disk
• catch any errors
  - if file not found
  - encryption error
